## About
#### The "Would You Rather?" project, lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.
#### This app is the second of three projects required for Udacity's React Nanodegree program.
#### It's built with React, Redux, React Router, & Redux Thunk.
